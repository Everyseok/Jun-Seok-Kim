        <p>
          The <strong>Lab of Combustion and Technology Convergence (LCTC)</strong>, directed by <strong>Professor Seong-Hwan Yoon</strong> at the National Korea Maritime and Ocean University, conducts advanced research on combustion, fire safety, and energy conversion systems. 
          Our work aims to enhance combustion efficiency, suppress hazardous instabilities, and develop eco-friendly technologies for the next generation of power and propulsion systems.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Major research topics</strong> include: 
          development of fire suppression technologies for <em>lithium-ion battery thermal runaway</em>; 
          mitigation of <em>combustion instability and flashback</em> in gas turbines; 
          <em>N<sub>2</sub>O decomposition and emission reduction</em> via high-temperature pyrolysis and numerical analysis; 
          <em>hydrogen production through NH<sub>3</sub> and LNG reforming</em>; 
          and <em>plasma-assisted combustion</em> for energy efficiency and emission control.
        </p>

        <p>
          The laboratory is equipped with state-of-the-art facilities such as a lithium-ion battery thermal runaway induction system, high-temperature gas pyrolysis reactor, various combustion test rigs (counterflow burner, slot burner, constant-volume combustion chamber, Bunsen and co-flow burners), laser diagnostics equipment (FT-IR, PIV), plasma power systems, and advanced computational tools including ANSYS CHEMKIN and MATLAB.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Representative achievements</strong> encompass international journal publications and patents on electric-field-assisted flame stabilization, NOx reduction, and electrically controlled fire suppression systems. 
          Notable studies include investigations of AC electric field effects on co-flow Bunsen flames, K–H instability impact on N<sub>2</sub>O decomposition, and simultaneous temperature–species–velocity measurements using TDLAS diagnostics.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Industrial and academic collaborations</strong> cover multiple national projects: suppression of thermoacoustic instabilities in gas turbines via electric fields (National Research Foundation of Korea), development of electric-field-assisted battery fire mitigation (Ministry of Education), integrated GHG control for maritime emissions (KIMST), and emission reduction for semiconductor and display processes (KEIT). 
          Through these projects, LCTC strives to contribute to cleaner combustion, safer energy systems, and sustainable environmental protection.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ultimately, the LCTC aims to merge combustion science with advanced control, electrohydrodynamics, and plasma engineering to establish a new paradigm of energy utilization and safety innovation.
